Different scenarios require different permission management, so flexible permission design has become a very important aspect.</p><p>At the same time, the permission mechanism is also the core principle of .bit&#39;s support for multiple chains.</p><h2 id="design-concept" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#design-concept" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Design Concept</h2><p>Every asset should distinguish between <strong>ownership</strong> and <strong>management rights</strong>. Ownership and management rights are sometimes unified and sometimes not. Unified situations include: a house purchased by oneself, one&#39;s own bank deposits, and so on. Non-unified situations include renting a house, a programmer&#39;s access to a company&#39;s database, and so on.</p><p>Starting from ownership and management, two additional roles are derived: <strong>Owner</strong> and <strong>Manager</strong>. These two roles have different permissions and use cases.</p><p>The design of <strong>Owner</strong> and <strong>Manager</strong> is based on the idea of separating ownership and management rights. Modifying resolution records is a high-frequency operation, while modifying ownership is a low-frequency operation. High-frequency operations frequently use private keys, increasing the risk of private key loss. This separation design ensures that the owner still has ownership of the account in case the manager&#39;s private key is lost.</p><p>The <strong>Owner</strong> and <strong>Manager</strong> can be the same address or different addresses. However, we highly recommend using different addresses as the owner and manager.</p><h2 id="owner" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#owner" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Owner</h2><p>The owner is the ultimate holder of an account and has the final disposition right over an account.
