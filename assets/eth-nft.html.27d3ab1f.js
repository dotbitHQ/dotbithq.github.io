The basic principle is to use a very secure cross-chain bridge to achieve this.</p><p>When a user initiates a cross-chain operation, the cross-chain bridge will first receive the operation on the chain for parsing, and perform a <code>lock</code> operation on the user&#39;s account. Afterwards, any user can mint the account to Ethereum, completing a complete and secure cross-chain operation.

Once the cross-chain operation starts, it must be completed in full. If you want to restore to the Nervos network after starting, you need to complete the second step <code>mint</code> operation first, and then perform [reverse cross-chain operation](#Reverse Cross-Chain Steps).</p><h3 id="reverse-cross-chain-steps" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reverse-cross-chain-steps" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Reverse Cross-Chain Steps</h3><ol><li>The user calls the recycle interface of the .bit NFT contract on Ethereum, and the .bit NFT on Ethereum will be destroyed.</li><li>The cross-chain bridge listens to the Ethereum network, obtains the user&#39;s cancel cross-chain request, and <code>unlock</code> the originally <code>locked</code> account on the Nervos network.</li><li>The user obtains a normal status .bit account and can perform corresponding management operations.</li></ol><h3 id="security" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#security" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Security</h3><p><strong>Cross-Chain Security</strong> The .bit cross-chain bridge is a very secure multi-signature cross-chain bridge.
